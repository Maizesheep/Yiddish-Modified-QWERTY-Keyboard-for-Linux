# Yiddish-Modified-QWERTY-Keyboard-for-Linux

This keyboard is a phonetic keyboard for Yiddish based off the US English QWERTY keyboard and Isaac Bleaman's Yiddish Klal keyboard for Mac, with some modifications that are mildly intuitive to me, with the principle that common letters should be easily typeable and the Shift key should modify letters or give Hebrew equivalents. Thank you to <a href="https://people.uleth.ca/~daniel.odonnell/Blog/custom-keyboard-in-linuxx11">Daniel O'Donnell</a> for creating the page that helped me understand how this works on Linux. Also, thank you to <a href="https://github.com/roelandmoors/azerty">roelandmoors</a> for the example of the xml file.

Most letters are phonetically equivalent, with exceptions including:
<ul>
  <li>i for י</li>
  <li>w for ש</li>
  <li>x for כ</li>
  <li>etc.</li>
</ul>

Shift + [key] includes these results:
<ul>
  <li>I for יִ</li>
  <li>W for שׂ</li>
  <li>X for ך</li>
  <li>etc.</li>
</ul>

Alt + [key] gives the combining diacritics for certain keys, as shown below with the symbols in the top right

I'm still not entirely sure how this is installed, so please find some tutorials on how to do this because frankly I find this very confusing.
